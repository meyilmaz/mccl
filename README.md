This is a coffeescript port of the stanford javascript cryptographic library created by Mehmet Yilmaz.

Anyone silly enough to use a library, particularly under the condition of a web browser that doesn't properly honor floating points or provide reasonable cryptographically strong pseudo random numbers - well, let's just say sometimes your book smarts will get trumped by hackers with a little common sense if you aren't careful thinking about how this library is used.
